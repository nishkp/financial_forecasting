##Problem Statement
In the financial industry, credit charge offs are a crucial metric to measure as they directly impact the health of the institution. A charge off occurs when a customer fails to make payment and eventually is written off as a loss. With that, it is increasingly important for banks to accurately forecast their charge offs in order to make informed decisions for the future.

Based on customer and macroeconomic data, forecast an accurate number of monthly charge offs over the period of February 2020 thru January 2021.
